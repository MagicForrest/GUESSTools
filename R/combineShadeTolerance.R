#' Combine shade-intolerant PFTs with their shade-tolerant cousins
#'
#' The effects of this depend on the shade-tolerant cousin PFTs being defined in the PFT list.  Note that this function modifies the original Field in place,
#' so make a copy of the Field first if you want to keep the old one.  Also it means that it doesn't need to be re-asigned with the "<-" syntax, you can actually just call the function.
#'
#'
#' @param x The Field which is to have the shade tolerance classes combined.
#' @param verbose Logical, if TRUE print some progress updates
#' @return Not necessary anything since the Field is modified in place, but it does return Field anyways
