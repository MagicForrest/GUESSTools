\title{Combine shade-intolerant PFTs with their shade-tolerant cousins}
\usage{
combineShadeTolerance(x, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The Field which is to have the shade tolerance classes combined.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, if TRUE print some progress updates}
}
\value{
Not necessary anything since the Field is modified in place, but it does return Field anyways
}
\description{
The effects of this depend on the shade-tolerant cousin PFTs being defined in the PFT list.  Note that this function modifies the original Field in place,
so make a copy of the Field first if you want to keep the old one.  Also it means that it doesn't need to be re-asigned with the "<-" syntax, you can actually just call the function.#'
